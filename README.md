# README

The purpose of this web application is so that you can see, upload or save any image, it is like VSCO but here you will not be a follower of anyone nor will you have followers, all the images you see at the beginning will be totally random regardless of the photos that you you have given "I like".
You will have a search bar to find a specific profile.
If you are not logged in, you will be able to view the images, but you will not be able to save them to your collection or "like" them. Once the session is started, you can also upload images (to create the account you will need to validate the email), basically you can use all the tools if you are logged in.
All the images you have uploaded will be on your profile and will be public, so anyone can see your profile and they will also see the images you upload.
A "social network" in which you will see all kinds of images, but you will not have to worry about being an influencer or being popular, since no one will be.
